# Cryptography-Work
Sample assignments completed; Cryptography course at Boston College

JLawhon1.py, JLawhon2.py, and JLawhon5.py are assignments I completed during my Cryptography course at Boston College. 
JLawhon1.py contains several functions that decrypt texts encrypted with binary versions of Caesar Cipher. 
JLawhon2.py contains several functions that decrypt texts encrypted with various flawed versions of Stream Cipher.
JLawhon5.py contains several functions that decrypt texts encrypted with hybrid RSA algorithms or Diffie-Hellman algorithms.

The javarandom.py, conversions.py, and rc4.py are written by Professor Howard Straubing at Boston College. 
I import these modules in my code, so I choose to include them for reference.
